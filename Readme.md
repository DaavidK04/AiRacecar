# AI Racecar

This project is a 2D racing simulation in Python using Pygame, where small cars autonomously navigate a track.

## Goal

* Control cars using simple sensors and neural networks.
* Train an AI to complete the track as quickly and efficiently as possible.
* Evolutionary approach: populations of cars, fitness evaluation, mutation, and crossover.

## Features

* Visualization of cars, sensors, and track.
* Live display of generation and fitness.

## Tools

* Python 3 + Pygame for simulation and rendering.
* Numpy for neural networks and GA.
